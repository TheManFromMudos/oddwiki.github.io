summary: |
  **Abe** is the primary protagonist of the [Oddworld Quintology](/games/quintology). He is a [Mudokon](/species/mudokon) that used to work at [RuptureFarms 1029](/locations/rupturefarms) as a Floor Waxer, First Class for a period of 15 years until, upon eavesdropping on a board meeting at the company and finding out that the next product would be made from Mudokons, decided to quit and take as many as his fellow workers as he could with him; which displeased his former employer [Molluck](/characters/molluck). Once he escaped, he quickly perished by falling off a cliff after being distracted by the curious sight of a [moon that contained the shape of his paw](/misc/moon).

  Fortunately for him, he was summarily resurrected by a Mudokon shaman known only as [BigFace](/characters/bigface), who informed Abe that he had a greater destiny then simply escaping. BigFace told him that the [Paramites](/species/paramite) and [Scrabs](/species/scrab) that RuptureFarms use as ingredients for their products used to be worshipped as sacred creatures. He then directed Abe to their respective nesting grounds, [Paramonia](/locations/paramonia) and [Scrabania](/locations/scrabania), and told him that if he completed the trials within, he would prove himself worthy of receiving the power of the demigod [Shrykull](/characters/shrykull). With it, Abe would be able to return to RuptureFarms, rescue the other Mudokons and shut down the plant.[^abes-oddysee][^nnt] In doing so, he would ignite a revolution against the [Magog Cartel](/organisations/magog-cartel) itself.[^soulstorm]

  To help him on his quest, Abe possesses psychic abilities: he can inject his conciousness into and take control of various objects, creatures and people and puppet their bodies as if they were his own. This proves useful in instances where he is unable to sneak his way through obstacles and must take a more direct, and often more violent, approach to the problem.

appearance: "Abe looks similar to other Mudokons: a bipedal lanky humanoid. The key differences in his appearance are the blue colouration of his skin, a reflection of his sadness; and that his lips are stitched together with string, a memento from his mother [Sam](/characters/sam)."

personality: |
  Abe is diligent and determined at achieving his goals. This is even shown back when he worked at RuptureFarms, where his efforts were recognised and he was awarded Employee of the Year. He is also intelligent, demonstrating the capability to navigate through a variety of cognitive gauntlets and various puzzles; whether they take the form of the various industrial facilities he infiltrates or the natural trials he faces to prove his worth to receive greater power to help him on his quest to save his fellow Mudokons.

  Despite this, he is also clumsy: he has failed to notice an incoming pipe while riding in a barrel in the [Stockyards](/locations/stockyards) of RuptureFarms and subsequently hit his head on it,[^abes-oddysee] been distracted by a sign while riding a ceiling-mounted handcar into [Feeco Depot](/locations/feeco-depot) and consequently falling off[^abes-exoddus] and tripped over his own feet after receiving the power of the Shrykull.[^nnt] His empathy for others, however, is the trait that ultimately drives him to save as many of his brethren, and anyone else suffering under the Magog Cartel's influence (even those who try to kill him like [Sligs](/species/slig)[^soulstorm]), as he can.
