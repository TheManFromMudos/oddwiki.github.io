name: "Scrab"

summary: "**Scrabs** are native wildlife that are generally found within their nesting grounds, [Scrabania](/locations/scrabanaia), or in the vaults that hold the bodies of [Mudokons](/species/mudokon) that belonged to the tribe of the [Mudanchee](/locations/mudanchee-vaults). They are feared predators to the point that not even [Fleeches](/species/fleech) will dare attack unless cornered, choosing instead to slither away."

description:
  appearance: "Scabs are quadrupedal, muscular creatures whose red-coloured skin is a reflection of the desert environment of their home. They possess a long jaw that, in combination with their four legs, they use to ram into and pierce through a prey at high speeds, then dig into and eat the prey's innards."

  behaviour: "The distinctive behavioural trait of Scrabs is that they are *highly* territorial. If two or more Scrabs encounter each other, especially while chasing prey, the two will shift focus from their prey to each other and battle to the death for the right to hunt said prey. Despite this, Scrabs are also capable of showing respect, such as when [one is present at the celebration of](/games/abes-oddysee) [Abe's](/characters/abe) [success at shutting down](/games/abes-oddysee) [RuptureFarms 1029](/locations/rupturefarms) or [when they patrol the vaults of the Mudanchee tribe to keep guard over their bodies](/games/abes-exoddus)."

history: "Scrabs used to have a symbiotic bond with the members of the Mudanchee tribe until the tribe became extinct. Out of respect, some now guard the vaults that contains the tribe's bodies. This dedication was interrupted by being hunted by the employees of RuptureFarms 1029, and other industrial facilities, in order to turn them into a food product. Once said facilities were either shut down or destroyed, the ones who stationed themselves at the vaults resumed their duty."
